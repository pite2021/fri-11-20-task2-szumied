Banking simulator. Write a code in python that simulates the banking system. 
The program should:
- be able to create new banks
- store client information in banks
- allow for cash input and withdrawal
- allow for money transfer from client to client
If you can think of any other features, you can add them.
This code shoud be runnable with 'python task.py'.
You don't need to use user input, just show me in the script that the structure of your code works.
If you have spare time you can implement: Command Line Interface, some kind of data storage, or even multiprocessing.

Try to expand your implementation as best as you can. 
Think of as many features as you can, and try implementing them.
Make intelligent use of pythons syntactic sugar (overloading, iterators, generators, etc)
Most of all: CREATE GOOD, RELIABLE, READABLE CODE.
The goal of this task is for you to SHOW YOUR BEST python programming skills.
Impress everyone with your skills, show off with your code.

Your program must be runnable with command "python task.py".
Show some usecases of your library in the code (print some things)

When you are done upload this code to your github repository. 

Delete these comments before commit!
Good luck.
